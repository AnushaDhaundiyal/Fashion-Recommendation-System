# Fashion-Recommendation-System

<p align="justify">As living standards have risen, fashion has become a key aesthetic expression. Attracted to visually appealing items, people have driven the growth of the fashion industry. However, the vast options on e-commerce websites make finding the perfect outfit challenging. To address this, we propose a personalized Fashion Recommender System that generates recommendations based on user-provided images. Unlike conventional systems that rely on purchase history, our project uses an image to suggest similar products. This system is build using TensorFlow and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The system provides personalized recommendations by analyzing user preferences and using KNN, it identifies the 5 most similar fashion items, creating a tailored "closest match" experience for users.</p>
